"Everything is a file" decribes one of the defining features of Unix, and its derivatives.

Commands:

ls - list directory contents
-l  use a long listing format.
-d  list directories themselves, not their contents.
-h  print human readable size

Output:
-rwxrw-r--    10    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.exe

| |  |  | |    |      |      |    \--- File Size

File type:
    Regular file(-)
    Directory file(d)
    Block file(b)
    Character device file(c)
    Named pipe file or just a pipe file(p)
    Symbolic link file(l)
    Socket file(s)

    
stat - display file or file system status

Access: 2013-03-30 16:12:22.000000000 +0800 - the last time the file was read
Modify: 2013-03-30 16:09:52.000000000 +0800 - the last time the file was modified(content has been modified)
Change: 2013-03-30 16:09:52.000000000 +0800 - the last time the meta data of the file was changed(e.g. permissions)

cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output
-n number all output lines

less - similar to more, but it has many more features. more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time. 

tailf - follow the growth of a log file

gedit - text editor for the GNOME Desktop

head - output the first part(default 10 lines) of files
-n print the first NUM lines instead of the first 10

tail - opposite to head

tac - cancatenante and print files in reverse - rev "cat"

rev - reverse lines characterwise

touch - change file timestamps

ln - make links between files
-s make symbolic links instead of hard links

vim

 which - locate a command

locate - find files by name. locate reads one or more databases by updatedb(8) and writes file name matching at least one of the PATTERNSs to standard output, one per line.
          so basically, we need to run updatedb command before locate.

find - search for files in a directory hierarchy
-type find files by type(regular file type is f)
-name find by name(wildcard ? means any character while * means 0 or more characters)
-user uname File is owned by user uname
-mmin n File was last modified exactly n minutes ago(-m(modify) can be replaced by c or a. min(minute) can be replaced by time(means day). +n stands for greater than n. -n stands for less than n. n stands for exactly n.
-exec command {} \; execute the command to the result from find
-ok command {} \; like -exec but ask the user first

echo - display a line of text
echo "test" > file replace all the content in the file with test
echo "test" >> file append test to the file

grep - print lines matching a pattern
-r recursive
-E interpreta PATTERN as an extended regular expression
-v invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

PATTERN - man grep

Commands with a single bracket overwrite the destination's existing contents.

Overwrite
> - standard output
< - standard input
2> - standard error
&> - stdout & stderr

Commands with a double bracket do not overwrite the destination's existing contents.

Append
>> - standard output
<< - standard input
2>> - standard error
>>file.txt 2>&1 - stdout & stderr

| - piping - What this operator does is feed the output from the program on the left as input to the program on the right

tty - print the file name of the terminal connected to standard input

echo "test" > /dev/pts/5 - display test at /dev/pts/5(result of tty)
ssh username@id_addr "echo test > /dev/pts/11" - display test at other user's tty

gzip - compress files to .gz
gunzip - expand .gz files

bzip2 - compress files to .bz2
bunzip2 - expand .bz2 files

tar - The GNU version of the tar archiving utility
c create
v verbosely list files processed
f use archive file or device ARCHIVE e.g. tar cvf new.tar file1 file2 file3
t list the contents of an archive
C change to directory DIR
x extract file from an archive e.g. tar xvf archived.tar -C ./temp/
r append files to the end of an archive e.g. tar rvf old.tar newfile1 newfile2
z --gzip e.g. tar zcvf new.tar.gz <-> tar zxvf new.tar.gz
j --bzip e.g. tar jcvf new.tar.bz2 <-> tar jxvf new.tar.bz2
