man 2 accept  -  accept  a  connection  on a socket
    before accepting, clilen = sizeof(cliaddr) is needed.
telnet / nc simulate client's behavier. e.g. telnet / nc 127.0.0.1 8888

inet_ntop  -  convert  IPv4  and  IPv6 addresses from binary to text form
inet_pton  -  convert  IPv4  and  IPv6 addresses from text to binary form
getsockopt,  setsockopt  - get and set options on sockets

Concurrence
fork a subprocess to handle, parent process keep listening after accepting.

Network programming use send/recv instead of read/write as network doesn't have cache
send, sendto, sendmsg - send a message on a socket
recv, recvfrom, recvmsg - receive a message from a socket
shutdown is a flexible way to block communication in one or both directions. When the second parameter is SHUT_RDWR, it will block both sending and receiving (like close). However, close is the way to actually destroy a socket.
abort - cause abnormal process termination
