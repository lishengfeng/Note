System calls
    How a user process contacts the Operating System
    For advanced services that may require special privilege
Standard I/O library
    Generic I/O support for C programs
    A smart wrapper around I/O-related system calls
    Stream concept, line-by-line input, formatted output, ...

utime, utimes - change file last access and modification times
man 2 mkdir - make directories
man 2 unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to 
man remove - remove a file or directory
man opendir - open a directory
man readdir - read a directory
man rewinddir - reset directory stream
man seekdir - set the position of the next readdir() call in the directory stream
man chdir - change working directory
man getcwd - get current working directory
man lstat - get file status
man ulimit - get and set user limits
man syscalls - linux system calls

The time consumed to execute a library function which does not in-turn invoke a system call is always lesser than the time consumed te execute a system call because the application program need not context switch between user space and kernel space.

The stdout stream is buffered, So will only display what's in the buffer after it reaches a new line(or when it's told to)
The stderr stream is unbuffered.

man 3 fopen - stream open function

strace -c - trace system calls and signals

man setbuf - stream buffering operations
man setvbuf - fuction may be used on any open stream to change its buffer.(unbuffered, line buffered, fully buffered)

man fread, fwirte - binary stream input/output

man getline, getdelim - delimited string input

man fgets - input of characters and strings
man fputs - output of characters and strings

man atoi, atol, atoll - convert a string to an integer

fprintf  sprintf - formatted output conversion

man ftell - reposition a stream
