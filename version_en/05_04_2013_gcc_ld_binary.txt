gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

-E will stop after preprocessing and generate some files
-S will stop after compilation and generate .i files
-c will stop after assembly and generate .o files

Without any stop, gcc will generate .out files
e.g.
    gcc main.c - will generate a.out
    gcc main.c -o main - will generate an executable 'mail' file

Setting a bit
Use the bitwise OR operator (|) to set a bit.
    number |= 1<<x;
That will set bit x.

Clearing a bit
Use the bitwise AND operator (&) to clear a bit.
    number &= ~(1<<x);
That will clear bit x. You must invert the bit string with the bitwise NOT operator (~), then AND it.

Toggling a bit
The XOR operator (^) can be used to toggle a bit - XOR means true when inputs differ(one is true, the other is false)
    number ^= 1<<x;
That will toggle bit x.

Checking a bit
To check a bit, shift the number x to the right, then bitwise AND it:
    bit = (number >> x) & 1;
That will put the value of bit x into the variable bit.

Changing the nth bit to x(0 or 1)
    number = number & ~(1 << n) | (x << n);
