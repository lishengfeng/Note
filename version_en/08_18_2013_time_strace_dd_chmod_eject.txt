dd - covert and copy a file
    if=FILE read from FILE instead of stdin
    of=FILE write to FILE instead of stdout
    bs=BYTES read and write up to BYTES bytes at a time
    count=N copy only N input blocks
    N and BYTES BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: c =1, w =2, b =512, kB =1000, K=1024, MB =1000*1000, M =1024*1024, xM =M, GB =1000*1000*1000, G =1024*1024*1024

dup, dup2, dup3 - duplicate a file descriptor

free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

ls -i, --inode
    print the index num of each file

sync - commit filesystem caches to disk
fsync, fdatasync - synchronize a file's n-core state with storage device

umask - set file mode creation mask

chown - change file owner and group

ln - make links between files (e.g. ln /etc/tmp /kkk)
