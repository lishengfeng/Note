/etc/init.d - The init.d directory contains a number of start/stop scripts for various services on your system. Everything from acpid to x11-common is controlled from this directory. Of course it's not exactly that simple.

    /bin/bash
           The bash executable

    ~/.inputrc

From man bash
    Command & - If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.

ctrl+z Stop the foreground process
jobs - List background processes
%n - refers to the background number n. E.g. kill %3
fg - Bring a background process to the foreground
bg - Restart a stopped background process

kill -l, --list - List signal names.
kill 0 - Signal 0 will not actually in fact send anything to your process's PID, but will in fact check whether you have permissions to do so.

signal - ANSI C signal handling
man 7 signal - signal macro

When handling signal or multithread problems, one would better use function end with _r
