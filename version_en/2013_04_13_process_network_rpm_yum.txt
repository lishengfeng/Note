    -e select all process
    -o specify user-defined format

    IP address: 192.168.1.254
    Subnet mast: 255.255.255.0 = /24

    ifconfig - configure a network interface
    ifconfig -a - display all interfaces which are currently available, even if down
    ifconfig eth0 - display interface eth0
    ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 - set interface ip_addr and netmask temporary

    -----------------------------------------------------
    (belows are only work for Centos & RetHat)
    neat-tui - use UI to set network permanently
    cat/vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
        ONBOOT=no Don't automatically start on boot
    /etc/init.d/network - manipulate networ

    DNS stands for domain name system whose main job is to translate domain name like www.uu.se to IP addresses
    cat /etc/resolv.conf - DNS resolver configuration file
    cat /etc/hosts - static table lookup for hostnames
    dig - DNS lookup utility - dig @server name type
    ping - sned ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network host
    -f flood ping - This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being droopped (only super-user may use this option)
    -c count - stop after sending count ECHO_RQUEST packets
    The TTL(from ping output) represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through before thrown away.
    mtr addr - a network diagnostic tool - report as round-trip-response times in miliseconds and the percentage of packetloss
    traceroute -n addr - print the route packets trace to network host

    HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol
    FTP  - File transfer protocol
    curl URL - transfer a URL - transfer data from or to a server
    elinks URL - similar with curl
    wget - the non-interactive network downloader.

    chown root:staff /u - Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".
    chown -hR root /u - change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".


/usr/bin - binaries usable for gerneral system-wide binaries
/usr/sbin - same as above, but for scripts with superuser(root) privileges required.

NFS stands for Network File System - allow a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.
showmount -e 192.168.1.254   -e  Show the NFS serverâ€™s export list.

mount - mount a file system
e.g.
    mount 192.168.1.254:var/ftp /local_directory/
    umount /local_directory/
    sudo mount -o remount,rw / - remount / as readable/writable

CIFS(used by Windows) stands for common internet file system which is the standard way that computer users share files across corporate intranets and the Internet    

smbclient - ftp-like client to access SMB/CIFS resources on servers
e.g.
    smbclient -L 192.168.1.254 --user blues      L list --user sets the SMB username or username and password
    smbclient //192.168.1.254/blues --user blues  - mount the file
