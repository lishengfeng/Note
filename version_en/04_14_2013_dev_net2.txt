FTP 
    default port:21
    Mode is decided by user
    Mode:
    PASV(passive mode) 
        The client establishes both channels. In that case, the server tells the client which port should be used for the data channel.
    PORT(active mode)
        The client establishes the command channel (from client port X to server port 21(b)) but the server establishes the data channel (from server port 20(b) to client port Y, where Y has been supplied by the client).
    *Passive mode is generally used in situations where the FTP server is not able to establish the data channel. One of the major reasons for this is network firewalls.
    In an active mode configuration, the server will attempt to connect to a random client-side port. So chances are, that port wouldn't be one of those predefined ports. As a result, an attempt to connect to it will be blocked by the firewall and no connection will be established.
    A passive configuration will not have this problem since the client will be the one initiating the connection. Of course, it's possible for the server side to have a firewall too. However, since the server is expected to receive a greater number of connection requests compared to a client, then it would be but logical for the server admin to adapt to the situation and open up a selection of ports to satisfy passive mode configurations.
    So it would be best for you to configure server to support passive mode FTP
